# bean-hccs

This is a Kingdom of Loathing script to do 1-day Softcore or Hardcore Community Service runs as a Pastamancer. At times I use it daily for ~1/120 softcore CS runs (yes, the name is a misnomer). Expect to need to make some changes, unless your set of IotMs is a strict superset of mine. For most folks, this will be an outline that can get you to daycount with some customization work.

You'll have to build this yourself to make modifications. This use a typical node.js / babel / webpack setup. To install:
- Install node.js and yarn (`npm install -g yarn`).
- Checkout the repository somewhere outside your mafia folder.
- Run `yarn install` and `yarn build`
- Symbolic link the build folder (`KoLmafia/scripts/bean-hccs`) into your mafia directory, as well as `KoLmafia/ccs/bean-hccs.ccs`. Or make a copy every time you update.
- Run `yarn watch` as you make changes and the build folder will automatically update.

If you are scared of TypeScript, the old ASH version is still available on the `softcore` branch.

The script is fine to run twice; if it breaks somewhere, fix the problem manually and then the script should start where it left off. I have tested it, but not extensively, so please understand that this code is not at the same quality level as autoscend. It may very well mess up spectacularly, and it has done so at times in my runs. You have been warned.

Notes:
- I currently take no astral pet and ascend Opossum sign. I run the peppermint garden and Asdon Martin. I have an ungulith in my chateau.
- The script assumes that you have Sweet Synthesis and a bunch of IotMs, but none of them are strictly necessary; if you are missing more than one or two of the leveling ones in particular (Prof/Kramco, NEP, Garbage Tote), your modifications to the script will fail to level enough to cap the stat tests. That will very likely mean missing daycount. If you are missing Synth, you can compensate by wishing for Experimental Effect G-9 or New and Improved to replace the +Myst buff (depending on the day), and Different Way of Seeing Things to replace the XP buff. You can still make 1-day using that plan but it will be tight. Every additional source of scalers and +XP% helps: LOV, Distant Woods, familiar weight for Professor, free kills for NEP, etc.
- Besides leveling, the Genie Bottle and Pizza Cube each save a ridiculous number of turns with wishes.
- You can assume that (almost) everything in my cc_snapshot is used.
- It assumes that you have painted Ungulith in Chateau Mantegna; if you don't have it, you can reallocate a wish or the fax to fight that guy. He saves 12 turns if you can get the weapon damage test to less than 28 turns. The fax is allocated to a factory worker, which saves 9 turns.
- For candy, the script assumes that you have access to Peppermint Garden and the Crimbo Candy Cookbook (it also gets the Stocking Mimic's bag of many confections, but this is only one piece). It will plan around other candy sources if you add code to harvest them. Simple candy can come from Candyblast, candy hearts, or tuning to a desert sign.
- Finally, it assumes that you have access to essentially every CS-relevant perm. The big ones are the +HP% perms, as they allow you to avoid using a wish on the HP test. If you don't have the Cargo Cultist Shorts, you will need Song of Starch (50%), Spirit of Ravioli (25%), and Abs of Tin (10%) at the very least, and you probably also need one or two of the 5% perms. If you don't have these perms yet, you will need to use a wish/pizza for Preemptive Medicine on the HP test. Bow-Legged Swagger and Steely-Eyed Squint are also crucial, as you would expect. And there are quite a few miscellaneous +item and +weapon damage perms; they all save turns, many of them several. Some unexpected skills help too: if you have Chateau, all the free rest skills save leveling turns.
- Note especially that Meteor Guide is insanely good and saves 16 turns though the Saber/Meteor Showered combination.
- Outside those IotMs, this path really rewards having a long tail of relevant items: +5 familiar weight here, 100% spell damage there, etc. It is hard to get around that fact if you want to make your runs faster.

Here is a rough plan using the Pizza Cube that is now outdated and the script no longer follows:
- Ascend Pastamancer/Wallaby. No pet needed if you have Pizza Cube, as the script will pizza for fam equipment. You can take the astral mask if you want to save one and a third turns on the item test and you aren't capping that test already.
- Cast inscrutable gaze and use Bastille.
- Rest twice at Chateau to reach Level 5 and restore MP.
- Cast Prevent Scurvy and Perfect Freeze; drink a perfect dark and stormy (3 drunk).
- TEST: Coil Wire (60 turns).
- Make meatcar (and any other Knoll stuff you might need, like full meat tanks) and tune moon to Blender for simple candy at Gno-Mart.
- Get available XP buffs: Synthesis, Inscrutable Gaze.
- Pizza for DIFferent Way of Seeing Things (+50% Mys XP). Get a quadroculars for later DISQ pizza.
- Fight 2 BRICKO oysters. (This step is not critical but the early meat is nice.)
- Buff mainstat to high heavens: Bee's Knees, Synthesis, Pill Keeper, Triple Size (2 drunk).
- Use Pill Keeper for familiar weight.
- Fight 10 copied sausage goblins at NEP, which burns the delay on the NEP noncombat.
- Get tomato and fruits from skeleton store using Saber YRs (or free kills if you don't need them to level) to avoid spending turns; make and use potions.
- Take Hovering Sombrero.
- Get +20% Mys XP buff at NEP (first encounter).
- 9 free fights at NEP, plus 7 free kills (Chest X-Ray, Shattering Punch, Gingerbread Mob Hit).
- Boost -combat and use all available free runs to find more sausage goblins at the Haiku Dungeon.
- Set BoomBox to weapon damage and adventure using turns at NEP until our stats are high enough to cap (I don't need to do this, but you might; 2 adventures are effectively free since you get a punching potion).
- Use oil of expertise, boost muscle and HP.
- TEST: Donate Blood (HP, 1 turn).
- TEST: Feed The Children (But Not Too Much) (Muscle, 1 turn).
- TEST: Build Playground Mazes (Mysticality, 1 turn).
- TEST: Feed Conspirators (Moxie, 1 turn).
- Use Pill Keeper semirare to get cyclops eyedrops. Optimal dog would also work.
- Drink astral pilsners (6 drunk).
- Get +item fortune boff and use synth. Use bag of grain.
- Take exotic parrot.
- Pizza for CERtainty and INFErnal Thirst. Get a cracker for Parrot.
- Cast Steely-Eyed Squint.
- TEST: Make Margaritas (Item/Booze, 2 turns with astral mask).
- Drink Ish Kabibble (2 drunk).
- Fax and saber YR a factory worker (female) (Cheesefax always gives female if you ask for "factory worker").
- Pill Keeper elemental res.
- Smash any ratty knitted caps and red-hot sausage forks for hot powder and sleaze nuggets (for lotion of sleaziness).
- Wish for Fireproof Lips.
- Use pocket maze.
- TEST: Clean Steam Tunnels (Hot Resistance, 5-8 turns).
- Pill Keeper familiar weight buff should still be active.
- TEST: Breed More Collies (Familiar Weight, 44 turns).
- Use squeaky toy rose, shady shades.
- Pizza for DISQuiet Riot (quadroculars for Q; you'll need to use a wish if you don't have a Q source).
- TEST: Be a Living Statue (Noncombat, 1 turn).
- Fight painted ungulith, use saber YR.
- Drink Sockdollager (2 drunk).
- Smash stuff for twinkly nuggets.
- Buy goofily-plumed helmet and get Weapon of Mass Destruction from the Hatter.
- Use a punching potion if you got one while leveling.
- Pizza for OUter Wolf (e.g. ointment of the occult/unremarkable duffel/whatever).
- Wish for Pyramid Power.
- Wish for Wasabi With You.
- Cast bow-legged swagger.
- TEST: Reduce Gazelle Population (Weapon Damage, 18 turns).
- Cast Simmer (1 turn).
- Buy 2 obsidian nutcrackers.
- Cowrruption, In a Lather, and Pyramid Power should still be active.
- Make a sugar chapeau.
- If you need more turns, fill your stomach and eat magical sausages.
- If that's not enough, use emergency margarita as your nightcap.
- TEST: Make Sausage (Spell Damage, 41 turns).
